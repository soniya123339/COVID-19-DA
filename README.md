# COVID-19-DA
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data to uncover trends, predict future outbreaks, and provide actionable insights for public health strategies.

Data Collection & Integration: Aggregated COVID-19 data from various sources, including government health databases, WHO, and Johns Hopkins University. Utilized web scraping and API integration to ensure up-to-date and accurate data.

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed large datasets to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers using tools such as Python (Pandas) or R.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to identify key trends, such as infection rates, mortality rates, and recovery rates across different regions and demographics. Used statistical methods and visualizations to uncover insights.

Predictive Modeling: Developed and validated predictive models to forecast future infection trends and resource needs using machine learning techniques (e.g., time series analysis, regression models).

Data Visualization: Created interactive dashboards and visualizations using tools like Tableau or Power BI to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders and the public.

Reporting & Recommendations: Generated detailed reports with actionable recommendations for policy-makers and healthcare providers to improve response strategies and resource allocation.

Collaboration: Coordinated with public health experts and data scientists to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the analysis, and to align findings with real-world applications.

Tools & Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Data Visualization:  Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Database Management: SQL
Statistical Analysis: Excel
